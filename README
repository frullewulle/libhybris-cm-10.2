libhybris for CyanogenMod 10.2-based Hardware Adaptions
=======================================================

This is upstream libhybris built against the CyanogenMod 10.2
headers based on Android 4.3.x Jelly Bean and packaged for Mer.

See http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Doc:_Building_Basics on how
to checkout the CM 10.2 source code for building the HA.

Android headers extracted using:
libhybris/utils/extract-headers.sh $ANDROID_ROOT android-headers
